# spring-ai-example

The Spring AI project provides a Spring-friendly API and abstractions for developing AI applications.

This is an example of using Spring AI to add generative AI in your Spring Boot application. 

## Prerequisites 

For Spring AI to function, itâ€™s essential to provide the API Key to establish a connection with OpenAI.

Sign up & create your own OpenAI API key here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

You will then need to add this API key to the api.key variable in the properties file.
